## Overview

The Flutter UI Component Hub is a curated collection of reusable widgets and animations you can drop into any Flutter project. From crisp buttons and cards to smooth progress indicators and toggles, this library helps you ship faster with a consistent, polished design language.

## Highlights

- Reusable building blocks: buttons, cards, drawers, footers, and more
- Delightful animations: progress, toggles, animated buttons, and transitions
- Clean structure: clearly grouped `Main_Components` and `Animated_Components`
- Consistent design: cohesive visual style across all widgets
- Ready to customize: simple APIs and readable code

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Flutter 3.x (stable)

Run the sample app:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Chinmoy-sh/The-Flutter-UI-Component-Hub.git
cd The-Flutter-UI-Component-Hub/flutter_components_hub
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Browse Components

All reusable widgets live under:

- `flutter_components_hub/lib/Flutter_UI_Components/Main_Components` – non-animated widgets (e.g., buttons, cards, drawers, footers)
- `flutter_components_hub/lib/Flutter_UI_Components/Animated_Components` – animated widgets (e.g., progress, toggles, buttons)

Explore the folders, pick a style, and use the relevant Dart file as-is or as a starting point for your own customization.

## Use In Your App

Choose one of the following:

- Copy the specific widget file(s) you need into your project and import them normally.
- Or, add this repo as a local package and import via `package:`:

```yaml
# In your app's pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_components_hub:
    path: ../The-Flutter-UI-Component-Hub/flutter_components_hub
```

Then import widgets from `lib/Flutter_UI_Components/...` as needed.
