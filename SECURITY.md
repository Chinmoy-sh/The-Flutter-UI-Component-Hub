2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After reporting a vulnerability, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Timeline**: We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue
4. **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
5. **Credit**: If you wish, we will credit you in our security advisory

## Security Best Practices

When using components from this hub in your applications:

### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version of components
2. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs when using form components
3. **Sanitize Data**: Ensure proper data sanitization when displaying user content
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls in your applications
5. **Security Testing**: Regularly test your implementations for security issues

### For Component Usage

1. **Review Source Code**: Always review component source code before integration
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test components in your specific use case environment
3. **Monitor Updates**: Stay informed about security updates and patches
4. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious behavior or potential vulnerabilities

## Security Considerations for Components

### Input Components

- Text fields should include input validation
- Search fields should prevent injection attacks
- Form components should sanitize inputs

### Display Components

- User-generated content should be properly escaped
- Image components should validate source URLs
- Dynamic content should be sanitized

### Navigation Components

- Deep link validation in navigation components
- Route parameter sanitization
- Authentication checks where applicable

### Animated Components

- Performance considerations to prevent DoS through resource exhaustion
- Proper cleanup of animation controllers

## Dependency Security

We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- **Flutter SDK**: We support the latest stable Flutter versions
- **Dart Packages**: We keep dependencies updated and monitor security advisories
- **Third-party Assets**: We verify the source and integrity of any external assets

## Security Tools

We use various tools to maintain security:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code analysis for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Code Reviews**: Manual security reviews for all contributions
